--- Outline steps needed to manually get my local changes to fresh WP install on AWS ---

(set up 2nd instance of WP locally)

Instructions should include:
- file by file, folder structure
- does the order matter?
- Do we have to restart a server or mysql, etc.


- Copy to staging folder first (in new production environment)
- Then copy to production (OR, use a symbolic link)
-
